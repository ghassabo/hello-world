Learning to call file from GitHub in SvcNow

When I know how to do this, my skills as a leader will be more valuable, and I can accomplish, 1:  Holding developers accountable for estimated hours of work, and 2: help out if we fall behind.  A third benefit will be helping customers visualize what they can have with mock drafts...then sharing those with the developers to make the changes.
